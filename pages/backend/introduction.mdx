# Introduction to the backend

The backend is essentially just an account server. It handles user accounts, syncing, and other account related features.

## Recommended Community Backend

I recommend using the [official-backend](https://server.fifthwit.net/)!

## Metrics

The backend exposes an endpoint for [Prometheus metrics](https://prometheus.io/) which allows you to keep track of the backend more easily, it can be accessed on `/metrics`.
Ex: https://server.fifthwit.net/metrics

To view these metrics properly, you can use the [P-Stream Metrics Dash](https://dash.pstream.mov/).
<Warning>
  This dash is not functioning properly right now. It does work but certain information
  can be wrong or outdated. This will be fixed soon
</Warning>

## Security

Optionally, is a  security setting:

- [Recaptcha support](./configuration.mdx#captcha), the server can verify Recaptcha v3 tokens on register and login.
