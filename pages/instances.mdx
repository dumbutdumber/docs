# Instances

This page showcases P-Stream instances hosted by the community.

<Note>
  * Sites with a `⭐` next to them are the best ones to use.
  * Sites with a `🪞` next to them are mirrors of P-Stream without changes.
  * Sites with a `💾` next to them use the sudo-backend meaning your data is synced across these sites.
  * Sites with a `📱` next to them have PWA support meaning you can use the site as a native app on your phone.
