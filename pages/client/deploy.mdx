  <Steps.Step>
    Congrats! You have your own version of P-Stream hosted.
  </Steps.Step>

## Method 4 - Docker Compose - Home Network

Docker is not recommended! It's much easier to host the static site and use a proxy like nginx to access.

This method is meant for those using a desktop device or single board computer with a minimum of 4GB of RAM such as a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) to run P-Stream on there home network for network connected devices.

<Steps>
  <Steps.Step>
    1. Ensure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed. In a newly created directory called `P-Stream` create a file called `docker-compose.yaml`. Paste the contents of the code block below into this file.
  
      ```yaml
      version: "3.8"
      
      services:
      
        movieweb:
          build:
            context: https://github.com/p-stream/p-stream.git#production
            # args:
            #   TMDB_READ_API_KEY: ""
            #   CORS_PROXY_URL: ""
            #   BACKEND_URL: ""
          ports:
            - "80:80"
          restart: unless-stopped
      ```
  </Steps.Step>
  
  <Steps.Step>
    Within the `docker-compose.yaml` file uncomment `args`, `TMDB_READ_API_KEY`, `CORS_PROXY_URL`. 
      - Make sure `args` is in-line with `context` 
      - Make sure `TMDB_READ_API_KEY` and `CORS_PROXY_URL` are tabbed once to the right of `args`.
  </Steps.Step>
  
  <Steps.Step>
    Put your proxy URL in-between the double quotes of `CORS_PROXY_URL: ""`. Make sure to not have a slash at the end of your URL. 
  
    Example (THIS IS AN EXAMPLE, IT WON'T WORK FOR YOU): `CORS_PROXY_URL: "https://test-proxy.test.workers.dev"`
  </Steps.Step>
  
  <Steps.Step>
    Put your TMDB Read Access Token inside the quotes of `TMDB_READ_API_KEY: ""`. Please read [the TMDB page](./tmdb.mdx) on how to get an API key.
  </Steps.Step>
  
  <Steps.Step>
    Uncomment and add any [additional environment variables](configuration.mdx) you may need. Remove the `VITE_` prefix when adding an environment variable to `args`.
  </Steps.Step>
  
  <Steps.Step>
    Save the file!
  </Steps.Step>
  
  <Steps.Step>
    Now use [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to run `movieweb` as background service.
  
      ```bash
      # P-Stream is the current working directory
      $ docker compose up --detach
      ```
  </Steps.Step>
  
  <Steps.Step>
    Verify that setup was successful
      - Navigate to `http://localhost`. You should see the UI for `P-Stream`. Find something to watch and make sure that it plays. 
      - View logs with
  
      ```bash
      $ docker compose logs --follow movieweb
      ```
  </Steps.Step>
  
  <Steps.Step>
    Set a static IP address for your device.

      - For Mac: [guide](https://www.macinstruct.com/tutorials/how-to-set-a-static-ip-address-on-a-mac/)
      - For Windows: [guide](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-set-up-a-static-ip-address)
  </Steps.Step>
  
  <Steps.Step>
    Navigate to movie web at `http://<static-ip-address` from another device connected to your network.
  </Steps.Step>
</Steps>

### To Perform Updates For New Releases of Movie Web

Make sure `P-Stream` is your current working directory and run:

```bash
# Re-build the image and start the container
$ docker compose up --build --detach
```
