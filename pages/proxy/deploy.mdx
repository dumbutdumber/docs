# Deploying the proxy


<Warning>
**Selfhosting the client as well?**

Please read [THIS](./introduction.mdx) and use Method 4 (Docker) or Method 5 (Manual)!

Cloudflare and Netlify's IPs are blocked by FlixHQ and the proxy MUST be hosted on a VPS or other server.

</Warning>

## Method 1 - Cloudflare (Easy + Best)

Cloudflare has a generous free plan, so you don't need to pay anything unless you get thousands of users.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/p-stream/simple-proxy)

<Steps>
  <Steps.Step>
    Create a GitHub account at https://github.com if you don't have one.
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>Click the `Deploy with workers` button above.</Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>Configure any aditional settings if desired.</Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>Click `Deploy` to deploy to Cloudflare Workers.</Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Congratulations! Your worker is now deploying. Please wait for the GitHub
    Action to build and publish your worker.
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    You can click the [`Worker
    dash`](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)
    and `GitHub repo` buttons to see the status of the deploy.
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    When the worker has deployed, you will need to take note of the URL. This
    can be found on Cloudflare under [Workers and Pages ->
    Overview](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)
    -> Proxy.
  </Steps.Step>

    Use the URL you took note of and [set up a custom proxy in the
    client](../extra/streaming.mdx#method-1-self-hosted-proxy).
  </Steps.Step>
</Steps>

## Method 2 - Netlify (Easy) 

Netlify has a very generous free plan, so you'll be able to host your proxy for free unless you get hundreds of users.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/p-stream/simple-proxy)

   </Steps.Step>

## Method 3 - Railway (Easy)

Railway offers you $5 of credit once you verify your account, which is enough to run the proxy for around 5-7 months.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/dyYHq1)

<Steps>
  <Steps.Step>
    Login to your [Railway](https://railway.app) account if you have one, otherwise create one [here](https://railway.app/login).

  </Steps.Step>
</Steps>

## Method 4 - Docker
If you know what you are doing, you should know what to do with this information. If you don't, then please follow our Cloudflare guides.

<Warning>
  Experience with Docker, domains and web hosting is **highly recommended** for
  this method. <br />
  [Deploying with Netlify](#method-1-netlify-easy) is easier and safer to do! You
  are exposing your server at your own risk!
</Warning>

P-Stream does not have a Docker image for the proxy yet. You can create one yourself or build from source. Alternatively, you can use the sudo-flix proxy Docker image found here: GitHub Container Registry under the image [`ghcr.io/sussy-code/sudo-proxy:latest`](https://ghcr.io/sussy-code/sudo-proxy:latest). It should work the same.


The container exposes the HTTP port (Without TLS/SSL) as `3000/TCP`.

## Method 5 - Manual
If you know what you are doing, you should know what to do with this information. If you don't, then please follow our Cloudflare guides.

Manually installing the proxy on your server. You may want to use an automated package manager like nixpacks to do this.

<Steps>
  <Steps.Step>
    Clone the repo on your server `git clone https://github.com/p-stream/simple-proxy`
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Navigate to the directory `cd simple-proxy`
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Install packages `pnpm i`
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Build the app `pnpm build`
  </Steps.Step>

  <Steps.Step>
    Start the proxy `pnpm start`
  </Steps.Step>
</Steps>

You'll need to configure port forwarding and firewall settings. Good luck.
